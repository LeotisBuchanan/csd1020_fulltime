## Course Summary  and next steps

We have made it to the end of the course. This as been a long two 
weeks. 

I have introduced you to two very popular and very capable tools. Mastery of these tools will really do wonders for your analytics and engineering career. 

Because of the various technical backgrounds of the class, I had to dynamically modified the course. 

Things I did not cover. 

1. Linux - Introduction to linux
2. Hadoop- Introduction to Hadoop

I also did not do a lot of lectures, instead I chose to take the hands on approach. This may have been somewhat challenging for some members of the class, but now you can say exactly what is it you can do and you now know that you can provide value.

## What can you do now: 

1. You can use Apache Spark SQL to clean, explore and analyse large datasets. 
2. You can use the elasticsearch stack to: 
    - ingest data 
    - query and analyse data 
    - create and deploy dashboards
3. Base on your project report you are now aware of the need to: 
    - clean data 
    - perform exploratory analyis on your datasets to understand the data
    - Plan your project    


## Next Steps. What next

From my experience at the my work, you now have enough knowledge to complete many of the tasks that I perform on daily bases at work. With this in mind. Your next steps should be: 

1. Keep learning I would recommend the following books for apache spark

   - Spark: The Definitive Guide :Big Data Processing Made Simple
   
     You can either buy this book or get access to it and other books 
     for free on the toronto reference library site. 
     see: 
     https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/torontoreferencelibrary/.
     Its free to become a member. 

   - High Performance Spark:Best Practices for Scaling and Optimizing          Apache Spark: By Holden Karau, Rachel Warren

    You should also follow the authors on twitter or read their blogs

2. Improving your code skills, learn scala and python

3. Build something of value, anything will do 

4. Start applying for Jobs in the field, be confident, do not call your self    Junior or coop etc. Widen your Job search, sometimes you may need to tell    prospects what you can do for them. Also remember that there may also be     a need for your skills in your home country. Offer a solution to an          existing problem you know about. 

5. Get out of house, start networking, attend meetups, attend big data          hackatons. Hackatons are good for building confidence. 

6. Consider creating a data product or starting a business. With cloud          computing like Databricks, you have access to the same computing             resources as large companies.

7. Keeping learning, the acquistion and use of knowledge will change your       lifes. Also knowledge is one of the best investment you make. Make time      to learn something knew everyday. 

Good luck, it was really great sharing my knowledge with you all. It was great learning experience for me. My knowledge of spark and elasticsearch as strenghthen in the last two weeks. You all really asked interesting and tough questions. You are welcome to connect be at my new privacy first email address.
