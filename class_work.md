## Exercise # 1


1. Create a new notebook in either zeppelin or databricks

2. Upload the sample gdelt data set. You are free to choose any subset of the dataset specified in the master dataset text file

3. Create a manual schema for the dataset

4. Write code to load the dataset into a dataframe. Your loading code must use the manual schema you created

Things to consider. 

1. Handling tabs vs csv. Yesterday we loaded csv data, think about how you would modify your loading code to handle this. 
2. How would you handle errors in the data?
